				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am a project manager at a large aerospace company. During my front-end web development certification at UW Professional & Continuing Education, I was taught about the keys to responsive design.</p>
				<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
				<div class="philosophy">
					<p>Web design is all about drawing customers in with <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/mobile-sites/get-started">streamlined and effective websites</a>. Websites should be accessible for all types of users, regardless of web browser, operating system or monitor size. </p>
					<p>Those with vision, cognitition or physical impairments are included in this web accessbility philosophy, as they may consist of <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html">20% of all users.</a></p>
					<p>A responive website also affects customers without disabilities, such as those with slow internet or situational limitations like glaring sunlight or broken arms.</p>
					<p>During my front-end web development certification at UW Professional & Continuing Education, I was taught the keys to responsive design, including mobile first design, fluid layouts, flexible grid and media queries.</p>
					<p>Accessibility overlaps with other best practices such as mobile web design, device independence, multi-modal interaction, usability, design for older users, and search engine optimization. Accessible websites can have better search results, reduced maintenance costs, increased audience reach, and demonstrate corporate social responsibility.<p>
					<p>Web accessibility is <b>required by law</b> in many situations.</p>
